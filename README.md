## Develop a model to detect the hand movement nearing to window by using Image processing.

### Steps to setup the project:
1. Extract all files and Navigate to that folder.
2. Install the required libs for the project by using this command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Now, as you might not have the ESP8266 Relay setup, run the code main_noRelay.py using this command - "python main_noRealy.py".
4. Use Space-Bar to Open and Close the Window, but notice that does it works when your hand/finger is under the rectangled area(window).
